Kyoko was a high school student. Jennifer, a student from Canada, was staying with
Kyoko's family. Kyoko and Jennifer were going to have job experiences together at a
*bakery for a week. They were going to work as *salespersons. Kyoko wasn't interested
in it, but Jennifer was because she wanted to have her own bakery in the future.
	On the first day of their job experiences, Kyoko and Jennifer werw told to learn the
names of all the Kinds of bread and their *prices. Mr. Takeda, the *owner of Takeda
Bakery, welcomed Kyoko and Jennifer with his chocolate *rolls. Kyoko and Jennifer ate
them. Jennifer said, "Kyoko, chocolate rolls are your favorite." He also said the most
important thing was to be *cheerful and kind to *customers and make them happy. Kyoko
thought that would be easy.
	After a while, the first customer came into the bakery. Kyoko suddenly became
revous. Soon she learned that talking to customers is different from talking to friends.
The only thing she could do was to say thank you in a small voice. She looked at Jennifer.
